# QM-QuickCargo

When in a menu that has your ship's cargo, this mod:
- Binds the "s" key to sort the currently open cargo tab
- Binds the 1 through 7 number keys to automatically send items that are hovered over to corresponding cargo tabs
try holding down a number key and moving your mouse cursor over a few items :)

***"jams!!!!!!!!! my items are missing!!!!!!!!! i hate you"***
this happens every once in a while, but not sure how to reproduce. 
you should be able to just sort your cargo (tap s or the top right sort button) and everything should come back
i'm 99% certain that it's impossible for items to get deleted by this mod

enjoy fellas. not sure if i'll continue adding stuff to this but i'm still open to suggestions

__Installation__
To use the mod, just drag the .dll file into your BepInEx plugin folder. 
The .dll is attached to this post and also on the releases page of my github repo
